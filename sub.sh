### **How to Run on the Cluster (Step-by-Step)**

**Goal:** Run your simulation on the free A100 GPU (`ID 1`) on node `gpu1`.

#### **Step 1: Connect to the GPU Node**

First, log in to the cluster, then jump to the GPU node.
```bash
# Log in to the main login node
ssh -p 22022 username@210.77.30.33

# Connect to the gpu1 node
ssh gpu1
```
You are now on the machine with the GPUs.

#### **Step 2: One-Time Environment Setup**

You only need to do this once. If you've already created the `pbh_sim` environment, you can skip this.
```bash
# Create a dedicated conda environment
conda create -n pbh_sim python=3.10 -y

# Activate the new environment
conda activate pbh_sim

# Install PyTorch for CUDA 12.1 (compatible with your driver)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Install other packages
pip install pyyaml numpy matplotlib
```

#### **Step 3: Place Your Code and Run the Script**

1.  Upload all your `.py`, `.yaml`, and the new `run_simulation.sh` files to a directory on the cluster (e.g., `~/my_pbh_project/`).
2.  Make the submission script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x run_simulation.sh
    ```
3.  Execute the script to start your simulation on GPU 1:
    ```bash
    ./run_simulation.sh
